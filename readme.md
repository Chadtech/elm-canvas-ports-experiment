This is an example of how to integrate an Html canvas into an Elm project using ports. [you can see it live here](http://elm-canvas-ports-experiment.surge.sh/). Altho, you should probably check out [joakin/elm-canvas](https://github.com/joakin/elm-canvas) if you really just want to do canvas stuff in Elm
